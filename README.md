## Overview

This is a practice project for my Front-End web development skills. The task is to try and build a clone of an existing web page and get it as close to the original as I can. Here goes nothing â˜º.

### The challenge

To reproduce the landing page of the website as closely as possible and implement all the UI designs from scratch if possible. Hence the tasks can be broken down into:
- Inspecting the page and downloading any resources needed
- Searching for any fonts and icons used on the page or any free alternatives on the internet
- Making sure the colors and animations looks as close to and smooth as the original
